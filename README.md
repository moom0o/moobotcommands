# CONTRIBUTING COMMANDS TO MOOBOT!
Moobot is not 100% open source, however it is now possible to contribute your own commands! Development has slowed down in the past months and the community now has a chance to add their own fun, useless, and shitty commands!

## How to contribute?
Please take a look at an example command in this repository, I have open sourced some commands to be used as examples for forming your own commands.

Make sure you have extensive knowlege of JavaScript, Node.JS, and Mineflayer.

Once a command is created you can create a pull request where the community can comment and may be approved. Then it will be added into moobot.

### Meaning of some things
Make sure to add `, id` to a say function if you intend to send messages into discord. (If there is no message id because the command was not executed in discord it will send into public chat instead of discord.)

The functions have been added to be used instead of directly using the mineflayer functions. You have the following at your disposal or create your own.
